# Castle-Clash
(2021) VR Realtime-Strategy Game

<p>This game was my A-Level CS project, for which there were no prompts, and which got an A*.</p>
<p>It features a tutorial that explains the game mechanics and highlights each area of interest in yellow as its are talked about. It also has a main gamemode where the player can gain gold overtime, spend gold on units, move units around by picking them up, and move units into the infirmary to heal them.</p>
<p>The main feature of the game is the ability to physically pick units up using the VR headset's controllers, which makes the game more immersive. The player plays against an NPC who plays moves that depend on the current state of the game; e.g places units in defence when their base is under attack</p>
<p>All assets for the game were made by myself with the exception of the font, the units' body model (but not helmet), and some ground textures.</p>
